# GazepointClient and DataForwardingServer

This project provides a Python implementation for interfacing with a Gazepoint eye-tracking sensor and forwarding the collected data to another machine. It consists of two main components: `GazepointClient` and `DataForwardingServer`.

## Overview

The `GazepointClient` connects to a Gazepoint eye-tracking sensor, retrieves gaze data, and sends it to the `DataForwardingServer`. The server then forwards this data to another client, typically on a different machine.

This setup is useful for scenarios where the eye-tracking sensor is connected to one computer, but the data needs to be processed or visualized on another.

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- Gazepoint eye-tracking sensor
- Libraries: socket, pandas, pygame, numpy, sdl2
- Download the Gazepoint API(Windows) from : https://www.gazept.com/downloads/?v=7516fd43adaa. In the password field, enter the password, provided in the physical instruction manual that ships with the sensor.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/Dhanushvarma/GazePointInterface.git
   cd GazePointInterface
   ```

2. Install the required libraries:
   ```
   pip install pandas pygame numpy pysdl2
   ```

3. Ensure your Gazepoint sensor is properly connected and its software is installed.

## Usage

1. Start the Gazepoint sensor and its accompanying software.

2. Run the script:
   ```
   python gazepoint_sensor.py
   ```

3. The script will connect to the Gazepoint sensor, start collecting data, and forward it to the specified client.

## Class Descriptions

### GazepointClient

This class handles the connection to the Gazepoint sensor and data retrieval.

Key methods:
- `connect()`: Establishes a connection with the sensor.
- `receive_data(server)`: Continuously receives data from the sensor and forwards it to the server.

### DataForwardingServer

This class sets up a server to forward the received gaze data to another client.

Key methods:
- `start()`: Starts the server and waits for a client connection.
- `forward_data(data)`: Forwards received data to the connected client.

## Configuration

You can modify the following parameters in the script:

- `HOST` and `PORT` in `GazepointClient`: Address of the Gazepoint sensor.
- `port` in `DataForwardingServer`: Port on which the forwarding server listens.
- `output_dir` in `main()`: Directory for storing output files.

## Troubleshooting

- Ensure the Gazepoint sensor is properly connected and its software is running.
- Check that the IP addresses and ports are correctly configured.
- Verify that any firewalls or security software are not blocking the connections.
